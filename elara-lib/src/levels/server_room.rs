**Ada**: Hey I heard you've been working on the infinite loop detector?

**Alan**: That's right! We can now detect an infinite loop and report it as an error before the code even runs. Should help prevent our engineer's computers from crashing. So far I've tested it with loops and while loops.

**Ada**: Cool cool. Some engineers might also use recursion as a way to repeat their code. Did you test for that?

**Alan**: Oh, I almost forgot. Let me search online to remind myself how recursion works...

**George**: I was watching the rovers while they were in "automated cleaning mode" earlier and I noticed something. It seems like while in this mode they are not able to move backward. Is that intentional?

**Mary**: Hang on...

**Mary**: I just looked over the code and I think you're right. Instead of moving backward they just turn twice, which takes longer. I'll make a note of this, but I'm not sure if we'll have the time to fix it.

**George**: Gotcha. As long as the rovers are able to do their job while cleaning, it's not the end of the world if they take a little longer to do it. I'm okay with de-prioritizing this for now.

**Mary**: Any resident CSS experts available to help me with something? I'm just trying to have a tooltip that floats above a button, but I don't want it to hang off the edge of the screen. I want it to be repositioned so that it's always visible.

**Alan**: I think @Ada has the most practice with the dark arts.

**Ada**: Lol honestly I usually just keep trying things until it works. But happy to take a look and see if I can help!

**Alan**: I heard someone mention the idea of a `wait` function which would just cause the rovers to wait and do nothing. What do you think?

**Marie**: Hmm.. we should try to keep the number of built-in functions to a minimum. Couldn't you do basically the same thing with `say("waiting")`?

**Alan**: Yeah, I guess you're right! I'll advise them to do that instead.

**Marie**: There are two hard problems in computer science...

**Marie**: ...cache invalidation, naming things, and off-by-one errors.

**Alan**: Uh oh, here we go again. Can't we just make a separate channel for jokes?

**Mary**: rofl.gif [image not found]

**Alan**: I'm pretty sure there are more than two hard problems in computer science.

**George**: Why do we even need an emergency shutdown button? The rovers aren't dangerous, are they? I mean aside from G.R.E.T.A. they're not even that big.

**Mary**: It's just a precaution. We don't expect anything to go wrong, but it's better to be safe than sorry.

**George**: I guess that makes sense. I'm just worried that someone might press it by accident. Can't we put it somewhere less conspicuous?

**Ada**: That would defeat the purpose. It needs to be somewhere that's easy to find in an emergency.
