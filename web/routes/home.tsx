            Right now, we are focusing on testing the core mechanics of the
            game, which includes writing code to control a drone and solve
            various puzzles. For now, you will need to switch between levels
            manually. Select a level above to get started!

            , chosen because it is easy to learn, runs efficiently, supports
            WebAssembly, and offers important safegaurds such as limiting the
            kind of code a user can write and preventing infinite loops. Almost
            all of the features of the Rhai language are supported so feel free
            to read the Rhai docs and play around a bit. The current levels are
            fairly simple, but future updates will include more complex levels
            designed to teach you about variables, control flow, user-defined
            functions, and other common programming language features.
