##### June 8, 2025 (version 0.9.0)

This version includes some big visual and gameplay improvements for certain levels.

- Improved visual style for the server room on Moonbase Alpha (i.e. the final level\
    of the game). This level now has a unique tile background and reflections, making it
    more distinct from the lunar surface background shown on the other levels (<a href="https://github.com/albrow/elara/pull/98" target="_blank">PR #98</a>).
- Asteroids now hit after a brief delay instead of hitting immediately when you press "deploy".
    This affects all levels with asteroids.
- Updated the level called "Asteroid Strike" to work better with the new asteroid mechanics.
    If you completed the old version of this level before, you may need to go back and complete
    this new version.
- Fixed consistency issues with the pixel art for G.R.O.V.E.R. and other rovers (<a href="https://github.com/albrow/elara/issues/96" target="_blank">issue #96</a>).
- Fixed a minor visual issue when hovering over elements on the board.

##### Jan 12, 2025 (version 0.8.0)

This version includes a number of UI improvements and quality of life changes. These are designed
to make the game look better and make it easier to navigate (especially between different levels).

- Introduced a new level select modal which shows a preview of each level before you select it.
- Improved the level layout, replacing plain white backgrounds and moving some buttons and UI elements to the top of the screen.
- Removed numbered axis labels and replaced them with a cleaner level border.
- Improved responsive design for smaller screen sizes.
- Updated relevant tutorial GIFs to reflect the new UI changes.
- Change step counter to start at 0 instead of 1 (<a href="https://github.com/albrow/elara/issues/89" target="_blank">issue #89</a>).
- Minor tweak to make it more clear how code length is counted for certain bonus challenges.

##### April 14, 2024 (version 0.7.0)

This update includes a brand new mechanic, crates! G.R.O.V.E.R. can pick them up and
drop them with the new `pick_up` and `drop` functions. This also comes with two new
levels that utilize the new mechanic. Stay tuned for more levels that use crates in the
future!

- Added two new levels: "Blocking the Way" and "Clear a Path" (now levels 8 and 9).
- Added two new functions: `pick_up` and `drop` that can be used to interact with crates.
- Removed the "Pressing Buttons" level (previously level 5). It was removed to make space for the new levels and because it was too simple. The subsequent level "Let Me In" does a perfectly fine job of introducing the buttons mechanic.

##### March 3, 2024 (version 0.6.0)

- Added two new cutscenes:
    - One after "On Your Own" which shows G.R.O.V.E.R. getting hit by a small asteroid.
    - One after "Three Lefts Make a Right" which shows G.R.O.V.E.R. visiting the repair bay.
- There's no easy way to see these cutscenes if you have already beaten these levels, but you can watch them directly on YouTube:
