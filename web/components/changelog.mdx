Most of the changes in the version are prep work for the upcoming Steam release! A lot
of work went into making the game playable on Steam, but most of those changes will be
invisible if you are playing on the web.

You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2657610/Elara_A_Coding_Adventure_in_Space/" target="_blank">wishlist the game on Steam now</a>!

- Added new ringtone sound effect and animation when you have an incoming call from Kalina (<a href="https://github.com/albrow/elara/issues/32" target="_blank">issue #32</a>).
- The "What's New" button is now highlighted on the title screen whenever there are new updates that you haven't seen yet.
- Preparation for Steam release:
    - Added Electron.js integration, configuration, and build commands in the `/electron` directory.
    - Change both journal and cutscene players to use local video files for the Electron build. (So that the game can be played offline).
    - Changed all links to open in new windows.
    - Added support for different zoom levels for Electron builds. (A workaround until <a href="https://github.com/albrow/elara/issues/75" target="blank">issue #75</a> is fixed).
