##### November 13, 2023 (version 0.2.1)

- Hotfix for Itch.io build.

##### November 13, 2023 (version 0.2.0)

- Added new backgrounds for the level screen and journal screen. Previously, these screens used plain white/black backgrounds.
- Greatly improved responsiveness for level screen and journal screen on mobile devices. The game now supports a minimum resolution of 1080px x 700px. Layouts for larger screens (especially higher than 1440p) are totally functional but could still be improved to take advantage of the increased screen real estate.
- Fixed an issue on Safari where tooltips were not being placed correctly on hover.
- Fixed an issue that would occur if you <a href="https://github.com/albrow/elara/issues/74" target="_blank">split function arguments across multiple lines</a>.
- Removed an unnecessary cookie that was being automatically set by Chakra UI.

##### October 25, 2023 (version 0.1.7)

- Slightly lowered volume on intro cutscene.
- Added music and sound effects to midgame cutscene.
- Added music and sound effects to final cutscene.
- Removed "WIP" disclaimer from cutscenes.

- Improved the <a href="https://github.com/albrow/elara/issues/70" target="_blank">messages on each data point in "Shutting Down"</a>. The messages are now much more interesting and provide subtle hints for certain bonus challenges.
