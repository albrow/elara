#### pick_up

Causes G.R.O.V.E.R. to pick up and hold the crate directly in front of him.

If there is no crate in front of G.R.O.V.E.R., calling this function will cause an error.
G.R.O.V.E.R. can only carry one thing at a time, so if he is already holding a crate,
calling this function will cause an error.

##### Examples:

`pick_up();` will cause G.R.O.V.E.R. to pick up the crate in front of him.
