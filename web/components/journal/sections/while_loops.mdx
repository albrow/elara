### While Loops

A while loop allows you to perform repeated actions. Everything inside the curly
brackets (`{` and `}`) will be repeated as long as the "condition" is true. The
"condition" is a boolean expression (i.e., an expression that evaluates to
`true` or `false`).

⚠️ Elara has safeguards in place to prevent infinite loops.

#### Examples

This while loop will run forever (or at least until the end of the level)
because the condition is always `true`:

```rhai
while true {
    move_down(1);
}
```

This while loop uses the condition `x < 5`, so that means it will run as long
as the variable `x` is less than 5. Since we increase the value of `x` on each
iteration of the loop, the loop will run 5 times:

```rhai
let x = 0;

while x < 5 {
    x = x + 1;
    say(x);
}
```
