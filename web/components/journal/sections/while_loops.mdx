### While Loops

<Video youTubeId="mCEAe5JF-vc" localVideoUrl={getLocalVideoUrl("while_loops")}/>

A "while loop" is sort of like a combination between an if statement and a loop.

A while loop looks similar to an if statement, but has some important differences:

1. A while loop uses the `while` keyword instead of `if`.
2. In a while loop, the code inside the curly brackets will be **_repeated_** as long
    as the condition is true. Whereas in an if statement, the code inside the curly brackets
    will only be run **_once_** if the condition is true.

The while loop below uses the comparison expression `x < 5`, so that means it will run as long
as the variable `x` is less than 5. Since we increase the value of `x` on each
iteration of the loop, the loop will run 5 times:

<RunnableExample
  code={`let x = 0;

while x < 5 {
  x = x + 1;
  say(x);
}`}
/>

This while loop will keep turning the rover until it is facing left. It works by using a
comparison expression `get_orientation() != left` (remember, the `!=` symbol means "not equal").
Once the rover is facing left, the condition will be false, and the loop will stop.

<RunnableExample
  code={`while get_orientation() != "left" {
  turn_left();
}

say("Now I'm facing left!");
`}
/>
