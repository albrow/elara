### Function

Functions are a fundamental building block of programming. They
are a way to organize code into smaller chunks that can be re-used
and combined in different ways. To use a function, you "call" it.

Some functions expect you to pass in one or more "arguments" when
you call them. The arguments affect the behavior of the function,
and different functions may have different types of arguments.

#### Return Values

Some functions have a "return value". That means the function spits
out a value whenever it is called. A function that has a return value
can be used anywhere you would use an expression. So for example, you
can assign the return value to a variable or pass it directly to another
function.

#### Examples

Calling the function `move_right` with the argument `5`:

```rhai
move_right(5);
```

Calling the function `get_pos` and assigning the return value to
a variable named `pos`. If you call `say` you can see the value
of the `pos` variable:

```rhai
let pos = get_pos();
say(pos);
```

You can also pass the return value of a function directly to
another function:

```rhai
say(get_pos());
```
