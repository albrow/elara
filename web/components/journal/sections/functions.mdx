### Functions

Functions are a fundamental building block of programming. They
are a way to organize code into smaller chunks that can be re-used
and combined in different ways. To use a function, you "call" it.

Functions can have inputs and outputs. The inputs (also called
"arguments") affect the behavior of the function, and different
functions may have different types of inputs.

Here's an example of calling the function `move_right` with the
input `5`:

```rhai
move_right(5);
```

Some functions, like the `get_pos` function, do not have any inputs.
When calling a function that does not have any inputs, you still need
to include the parentheses (just don't put anything inside them):

```rhai
get_pos();
```

#### Outputs

Some functions may have an output, also called a "return value". If a
function has an output, it just means that it spits out a value whenever
it is called. The output of a function can be used the same way as
any other value.

For example, the `random` function outputs (or "returns") a random
number between 1 and 100. We can use the output of the `random` function
in the same way as any other number. E.g., we can use it as the _input_ to
the `say` function:

```rhai
say(random());
```

Not all functions have an output. For example, the `move_right` function
does not output anything.
