### Functions

Functions are a fundamental building block of programming. They
let you organize code into smaller chunks that can be re-used
and combined in different ways. To use a function, you "call" it.

Functions can have inputs (also called "arguments") that affect
the behavior of the function. Different functions may have
different types of inputs.

Here's an example of calling the `say` function with the
input `"Hello, world!"`:

<RunnableExample
  code={`say("Hello, world!");
`}
/>

Here's an example of calling the `move_right` function with
the input `5`:

<RunnableExample
  code={`move_right(5);
`}
/>

{/* TODO(albrow): Move this somewhere else? */}

Some functions, like the `get_pos` function, do not have any inputs.
When calling a function that does not have any inputs, you still need
to include the parentheses (just don't put anything inside them):

<RunnableExample
  code={`get_pos();
`}
/>
