### Functions

Functions are a fundamental building block of programming. They
let you organize code into smaller chunks that can be re-used
and combined in different ways. To use a function, you "call" it.

Functions can have inputs (also called "arguments") that affect
their behavior. Different functions may have different types of
inputs.

Here's an example of calling the `say` function with the
input `"Hello, world!"`:

<RunnableExample
  code={`say("Hello, world!");
`}
/>

Here's an example of calling the `move_right` function with
the input `5`:

<RunnableExample
  code={`move_right(5);
`}
/>
