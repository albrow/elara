### Functions

Functions are a fundemental building block of programming. They
are a way to organize code into smaller chunks that can be re-used
and combined in different ways. To use a function, you "call" it.

Some functions expect you to pass in one or more "arguments" when
you call them. The arguments affect the behavior of the function,
and different functions may have different types of arguments.

#### Examples

Here's an example of calling the function `move_right` with the argument
`5`:

```rhai
move_right(5);
```
