### Creating Your Own Functions

<YoutubeVideo embedId="dhzYHUqEH9E" />

At this point, you are probably pretty familiar with using functions, but you
can also create your own! This is a powerful and important part of programming
because it allows you to reuse and adapt code that you have already written.

To define a new function, you write the `fn` keyword, the name of the function,
and then a list of inputs in parentheses (if any). Following that, the
code in between the two curly brackets make up the "body" of the function which
will be run when the function is called.

‚ÑπÔ∏è **Tip:** Only built-in functions are highlighted in purple.

‚ÑπÔ∏è **Tip:** If a function doesn't have any inputs, you still need to include
the empty parentheses.

Here's an example of creating a new function that does not expect any inputs:

<RunnableExample
  code={`// This function causes the rover to do a full rotation
// (360 degrees).
fn do_a_360() {
  turn_left();
  turn_left();
  turn_left();
  turn_left();
}

do_a_360();
`}
/>

Here's an example of a function called `greet` that has one input:
`name`. The function will cause the rover to say a greeting using whatever
name was passed in as an input.

üí° **Try it**: Try calling the `greet` function with your own name as the input.

<RunnableExample
  code={`// This function has one input: the name of the person to
// greet.
fn greet(name) {
  say("Nice to meet you, " + name);
}

// Call the greet function with a few different names.
greet("Alice");
greet("Bob");
greet("Charlie");
`}
/>

You won't necessarily need to do this yet, but you can also create
functions that have an output. To do that, you use the `return` keyword. Here's
an example of a function called `add` that has two inputs: `a` and `b`. The
function will add the two numbers together and output the result.

<RunnableExample
  code={`fn add(a, b) {
  // The return keyword causes the function to output (a.k.a.
  // return) something. In this case, we are outputting a + b.
  return a + b;
}

say(add(1, 2));
say(add(3, 4));
`}
/>
