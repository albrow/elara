### Creating Your Own Functions

At this point, you are probably pretty familiar with using functions, but you
can also create your own! This is a powerful and important part of programming
because it allows you to reuse and adapt code that you have already written.

To define a new function, you write the `fn` keyword, the name of the function,
and then a list of inputs in parentheses (if any). Following that, the
code in between the two curly brackets make up the "body" of the function which
will be run when the function is called.

ℹ️ **Tip:** If a function doesn't have any inputs, you still need to include
the empty parentheses.

Here's an example of creating a new function that does not expect any inputs:

<RunnableExample
  code={`// This function causes the rover to do a full rotation
// (360 degrees).
fn do_a_360() {
  turn_left();
  turn_left();
  turn_left();
  turn_left();
}

do_a_360();
`}
/>

Lastly, here's an example of a function called `greet` that expects a name
as an input:

<RunnableExample
  code={`// This function has one input: the name of the person to greet.
fn greet(name) {
  say("Nice to meet you, " + name);
}

// Call the greet function with a few different names.
greet("Alice");
greet("Bob");
greet("Charlie");
`}
/>
