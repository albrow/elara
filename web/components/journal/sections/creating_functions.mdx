### Creating Your Own Functions

<Video youTubeId="KChh3VbnJFI" localVideoUrl={getLocalVideoUrl("creating_functions")} />

At this point, you are probably pretty familiar with using functions, but you
can also create your own! This is a powerful and important part of programming
because it allows you to reuse and adapt code that you have already written.

<Card type="tip">Only built-in functions are highlighted in purple.</Card>

<Card type="tip">If a function doesn't have any inputs, you still need to include the empty parentheses.</Card>

Here's an example of creating a new function that does not expect any inputs:

<RunnableExample
  code={`// This function causes the rover to do a full rotation
// (360 degrees).
fn do_a_360() {
  turn_left();
  turn_left();
  turn_left();
  turn_left();
}

do_a_360();
`}
/>

Here's an example of a function called `greet` that has one input:
`name`. The function will cause the rover to say a greeting using whatever
name was passed in as an input.

<Card type="try_it">Try calling the `greet` function with your own name as the input.</Card>

<RunnableExample
  code={`// This function has one input: the name of the person to
// greet.
fn greet(name) {
  say("Nice to meet you, " + name);
}

// Call the greet function with a few different names.
greet("Alice");
greet("Bob");
greet("Charlie");
`}
/>

You won't necessarily need to do this yet, but you can also create
functions that have an output. To do that, you use the `return` keyword. Here's
an example of a function called `add` that has two inputs: `a` and `b`. The
function will add the two numbers together and output the result.

<RunnableExample
  code={`fn add(a, b) {
  // The return keyword causes the function to output (a.k.a.
  // return) something. In this case, we are outputting a + b.
  return a + b;
}

say(add(1, 2));
say(add(3, 4));
`}
/>
