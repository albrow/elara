### Loops

Loops are a way to repeat code over and over again. To create a
new loop, use the `loop` keyword followed by curly brackets (`{` and `}`)
Everything inside the curly brackets will be repeated until either:

- (a) you reach the end of the level or
- (b) run out of energy.

(There is also a different way to end a loop, but we'll get to that later).

For example, this loop will cause the rover to move forward and backward,
over and over again until it runs out of energy.

<RunnableExample
  code={`loop {
  say("I'm in a loop!");
  move_forward(1);
  move_backward(1);
}`}
/>

Elara has safeguards in place to prevent infinite loops. If a possible
infinite loop is detected, you will see an error message. Below is an
example of an infinite loop. In this case, the loop runs forever because
the rover never uses any energy (e.g. by moving).

ðŸ’¡ **Try it**: Run the code to see what happens. You should see an error.

<RunnableExample
  code={`loop {
  say("This loop will never end!");
}`}
/>
