### Loops

Loops are a way to repeat code over and over again. Everything
inside the curly braces (`{` and `}`) will be repeated until you
reach the end of the level or run out of fuel.

For example, this loop will cause the rover to move right 1 space,
then left 1 space, over and over again until it runs out of fuel.

```
loop {
    move_right(1);
    move_left(1);
}
```

⚠️ Be careful! Elara has safeguards in place to prevent infinite loops.
If a possible infinite loop is detected, you will see an error message.
