### While Loop

A while loop allows you to perform repeated actions. Everything inside the curly
braces (`{` and `}`) will be repeated as long as the "condition" is true. The
"condition" is a boolean expression (i.e., an expression that evaluates to
`true` or `false`).

In Elara, there are some safegaurds in place to prevent infinite loops: the code
stops running if you reach the end of a level, e.g. by reaching the objective or
running out of fuel. As a backup safegaurd, the code will stop running
if an infinite loop is detected, in which case you'll see an error. (This can happen
if the condition is always true and the code inside the loop doesn't use any fuel).

#### Comparison Operators

The following comparison operators can be used in boolean expressions:

| Operator | Example  | Meaning                             |
| -------- | -------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `<`      | `x < 5`  | `x` is "less than" 5                |
| `>`      | `x > 5`  | `x` is "greater than" 5             |
| `==`     | `x == 5` | `x` is "equal to" 5                 |
| `!=`     | `x != 5` | `x` is "not equal to" 5             |
| `<=`     | `x <= 5` | `x` is "less than or equal to" 5    |
| `>=`     | `x >= 5` | `x` is "greater than or equal to" 5 |

#### Examples

This while loop will run forever (or at least until the end of the level)
becuase the condition is always `true`:

```rhai
while true {
    move_down(1);
}
```

This while loop uses the condition `x < 5`, so that means it will run as long
as the variable `x` is less than 5. Since we increase the value of `x` on each
iteration of the loop, the loop will run 5 times:

{/* TODO(albrow): Add a call to "say" or "print" here? */}

```rhai
let x = 0;

while x < 5 {
    x = x + 1;
}
```
