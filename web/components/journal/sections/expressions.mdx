### Expressions

"Expressions" are pieces of code that result in some value. There
are many different kinds of expressions, for example a "literal
expression" like the number `42` or a math expression like `2 + 3`.

Expressions can even contain other expressions! For example a math
expression like `2 + 3` technically contains two expressions (the
number `2` and the number `3`) joined by the `+` operator. The result
of the expression `2 + 3` is the number `5`.
