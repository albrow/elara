### If Statements

<YoutubeVideo embedId="hb0o3I5md7o" />

An "if statement" allows you to run certain code if something is true.
You can use an if statement to perform different actions based on different
conditions. If the condition is true, the code inside the curly brackets will
be run. On the other hand, if the condition is false, the code inside the curly
brackets will not be run.

<Card type="try_it">On line 1, try changing the value of `x` to something greater than 10.</Card>

<RunnableExample
  code={`let x = 5;
if x < 10 {
  // This code will only run if x is less than 10.
  say("x is less than 10");
}`}
/>


Below is an example that uses strings instead. Remember:

- A single equals sign (`=`) is used to assign a value to a variable.
- A double equals sign (`==`) is used to compare two values.

<Card type="try_it">On line 1, change the `fruit` variable to be "oranges" instead of "apples".</Card>

<RunnableExample
  code={`let fruit = "apples";

if fruit == "apples" {
  // This code will only run if the fruit equals "apples".
  say("fruit is equal to 'apples'");
}

if fruit == "oranges" {
  // This code will only run if the fruit equals "oranges".
  say("fruit is equal to 'oranges'");
}
`}
/>
