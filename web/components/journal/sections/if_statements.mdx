### If Statements

An "if statement" allows you to run certain code if something is true.
You can use an if statement to perform different actions based on different
conditions.

You write an if statement with the `if` keyword, a comparison expression, and
then some code in between two curly brackets (`{` and `}`). If the comparison
is true, the code inside the curly brackets will be run. However if the comparison
is false, the code inside the curly brackets will be skipped.

ðŸ’¡ **Try it**: Try changing the value of `x` to something greater than 10.

<RunnableExample
  code={`let x = 5;
if x < 10 {
  // This code will only run if x is less than 10.
  say("x is less than 10");
}`}
/>

You can also optionally extend an `if` statement by adding the `else` keyword.
The code after the `else` keyword will only be run if the comparison is _false_.

ðŸ’¡ **Try it**: Try changing the value of `x`.

<RunnableExample
  code={`let x = 12;
if x < 10 {
  // This code will run if x is less than 10.
  say("x is less than 10");
} else {
  // This code will run if x is *not* less than 10.
  say("x is not less than 10");
}`}
/>

There is one more version of the `if` statement, which includes the `else if` keyword.
This allows you to check multiple different comparisons in a single statement. When using
`else if`, the comparisons are checked in order. If the first condition is false, then
the second condition is checked, and so on. An optional `else` statement at the end
will be run if none of the other comparisons are true.

<RunnableExample
  code={`let x = 7;
if x < 5 {
  // This code will run if x is less than 5.
  move_right(1);
} else if x < 10 {
  // This code will run if x is less than 10, but *not* less than 5.
  move_left(1);
} else {
  // This code will run if x is not less than 5 or 10.
  move_down(1);
}`}
/>
