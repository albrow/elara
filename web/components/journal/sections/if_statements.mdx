### If Statements

An "if statement" allows you to run certain code if something is true.
You can use an if statement to perform different actions based on different
conditions.

You write an if statement with the `if` keyword, a comparison expression, and
then some code in between two curly brackets (`{` and `}`). If the comparison
is true, the code inside the curly brackets will be run. However if the comparison
is false, the code inside the curly brackets will be skipped.

ðŸ’¡ **Try it**: Try changing the value of `x` to something greater than 10.

<RunnableExample
  code={`let x = 5;
if x < 10 {
  // This code will only run if x is less than 10.
  say("x is less than 10");
}`}
/>

Below is an example that uses strings instead. Remember:

- A single equals sign (`=`) is used to assign a value to a variable.
- A double equals sign (`==`) is used to compare two values.

ðŸ’¡ **Try it**: Try changing the value of `fruit` to the string "apples".

<RunnableExample
  code={`let fruit = "oranges";

if fruit == "apples" {
  // This code will only run if fruit is equal to the string
  // "apples".
  say("fruit is equal to 'apples'");
}

if fruit == "oranges" {
  // This code will only run if y is equal to the string
  // "oranges".
  say("fruit is equal to 'oranges'");
}`}
/>
