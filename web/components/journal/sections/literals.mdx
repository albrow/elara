### Literals

"Literals" are the simplest kind of expression. A literal is just
a value that appears directly in your code. Literals always have a
specific type. For example, `42` is a literal number, and
`"Hello, world!"` is a literal string.

#### Types of Literals

This table lists the different kinds of literals that you can expect
to use in Elara:

| Type     | Description                                                                        | Example           |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `i64`    | A number or "integer", i.e. a whole number that can be either positive or negative | `123`             |
| `string` | A sequence of characters, i.e. text                                                | `"Hello, world!"` |
| `bool`   | A boolean value, i.e. either `true` or `false`                                     | `true`            |
| `array`  | A list of values                                                                   | `[1, 2, 3]`       |
