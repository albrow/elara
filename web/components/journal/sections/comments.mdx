### Comments

Every line that starts with two slashes `//` is called a
"comment". Comments don't affect the rover at all; they are
just little notes to help you understand the code. Feel free
to add your own comments too!

Here's an example of a basic comment:

<RunnableExample
  code={`// This is a comment.
// You can have any number of comments in your code.
`}
/>

Comments might contain something that _looks_ like code, but if
it's inside a comment, it won't do anything. For example, this
code will not actually say "hello", because the function call is
inside a comment:

<RunnableExample code={`// say("hello");`} />

ℹ️ **Tip**: Try removing the two slashes before the `say` function above
and see what happens.
