### Comments

<Video youTubeId="flGWBj1hDps" localVideoUrl={getLocalVideoUrl("comments")}/>

Every line that starts with two slashes `//` is called a
"comment". Comments don't affect the rover at all; they are
just little notes to help you understand the code.

Most of the levels in Elara have some comments to help you get
started. Make sure to read comments carefully! They can really help you
understand what is going on 🙂 You can also add your own comments
to any code that you write.

Below is some example code that includes comments. If you run this code
nothing will happen (which is expected).

<RunnableExample
  code={`// This is a comment.
// You can have any number of comments in your code.
// Comments don't affect the rover at all.
`}
/>
