### Comments

Every line that starts with two slashes `//` is called a
"comment". Comments don't affect the rover at all; they are
just little notes to help you understand the code. Feel free
to add your own comments too!

Here's an example of a basic comment:

<RunnableExample
  code={`// This is a comment.
// You can have any number of comments in your code.
`}
/>

{/* TODO(albrow): Consider tweaking this wording. */}
In this next example, the `say` function is part of a comment. That means
the code in that line will not run and the rover will not say anything:

<RunnableExample code={`// say("hello");`} />

Try removing the two slashes before the `say` function above and
see what happens.
