### Comments

Every line that starts with two slashes `//` is called a
"comment". Comments don't affect the rover at all; they are
just little notes to help you understand the code. Feel free
to add your own comments too!

#### Examples

A basic comment:

```rhai
// This is a comment.
```

Here, the `say` function is preceded by two slashes. That means
it is "commented out" and will not run (i.e. the rover will not
say anything):

```rhai
// say("hello");
```
