### Arrays

An array is just a list of things. The things inside of an array are called
its "elements". An array can hold elements of any type (e.g. numbers or strings).

You can create an array by using square brackets (`[` and `]`) and separating
each element with a comma (`,`).

<RunnableExample code={`// You can use an array as the input to a function.
say([1, 2, 3, 4]);

// Or you can create an array and assign it to a variable.
// This code creates an array called "things"
let things = [42, "piano", true];
say(things);
`}/>

You can access the elements of an array by providing an "index" in
between square brackets (`[` and `]`).

ℹ️ **Tip:** The first element of the array has index `0`, **_not_** `1`.

<RunnableExample
  code={`let fruits = ["apples", "oranges", "bananas"];

// Get the first element of the array, i.e. the element with index 0.
let first_fruit = fruits[0];
say(first_fruit);

// Get the other elements of the array...
say(fruits[1]);
say(fruits[2]);
`}
/>

You can also change a specific element in an array by using the assignment
operator (i.e. a single equals sign `=`). This is similar to changing the
value of a variable.

<RunnableExample
  code={`let fruits = ["apples", "oranges", "bananas"];
say(fruits);

// Change the value of the first element of the array.
fruits[0] = "pears";
say(fruits);
`}
/>

Finally, you can use the `push` function to add an element to the end
of an array. The push function expects two inputs: an array and the value
you want to add.

<RunnableExample
  code={`let words = ["fee", "fi"];
say(words);

// Add the elements "fo" and "fum" to the end of the array.
push(words, "fo");
say(words);
push(words, "fum");
say(words);
`}
/>
