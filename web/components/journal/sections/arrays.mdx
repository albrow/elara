### Arrays

An array is just a list of things. The things inside of an array are called
its "elements". An array can hold elements of any type (e.g. numbers or strings).

You can create a new array by using square brackets (`[` and `]`) and separating
each element with a comma (`,`).

<RunnableExample code={`// You can use an array as the input to a function.
say([1, 2, 3, 4]);

// Or you can create an array and assign it to a variable.
// This code creates an array called "things"
let things = [42, "piano", true];
say(things);
`}/>

You can access the individual elements inside an array by providing an "index" in
between square brackets (`[` and `]`).

ℹ️ **Tip:** The first element of the array has an index of `0`, **_not_** `1`.

<RunnableExample
  code={`let fruits = ["apples", "oranges", "bananas"];

// Get the first element of the array, i.e. the element with index 0.
let first_fruit = fruits[0];
say(first_fruit);

// Get the other elements of the array...
say(fruits[1]);
say(fruits[2]);
`}
