### Arrays

An array is a list of values. The values can be of any type, and they
are not necessarily all of the same type. The values inside an array
are sometimes called "elements".

You can access the elements of an array by providing an "index" in
between square brackets (`[` and `]`). See below for some examples. Note
that the first element of the array has index `0`, **_not_** `1`.

You can also use the `len` function on an array to determine its length,
i.e., how many elements it contains.

#### Examples

Declaring an array and assigning it to a variable:

```rhai
let arr = [1, 2, 3];
```

Accessing the first element of an array:

```rhai
let arr = [1, 2, 3];
say(arr[0]);
```

Getting the next element of an array (i.e., the element at index 1):

```rhai
let arr = [1, 2, 3];
say(arr[1]);
```

Using the `len` function to determine the length of an array:

```rhai
let arr = [1, 2, 3];
say(len(arr));
```
