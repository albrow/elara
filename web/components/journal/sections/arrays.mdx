### Arrays

An array is just a list of values. The values can be of any type, and they
are not necessarily all of the same type. The values inside an array
are sometimes called "elements".

<RunnableExample code={`// You can use an array as the input to a function.
say([1, 2, 3, 4]);

// Or you can create an array and assign it to a variable.
// This code creates an array called "fruits"
let fruits = ["apples", "oranges", "bananas"];
say(fruits);
`}/>

You can access the elements of an array by providing an "index" in
between square brackets (`[` and `]`).

ℹ️ **Tip:** The first element of the array has index `0`, **_not_** `1`.

<RunnableExample
  code={`let fruits = ["apples", "oranges", "bananas"];

// Get the first element of the array, i.e. the element with index 0.
let first_fruit = fruits[0];
say(first_fruit);

// Get the other elements of the array...
say(fruits[1]);
say(fruits[2]);
`}
/>

You can also change the value of an element in an array by using the assignment
operator (i.e. a single equals sign `=`). This is similar to changing the
value of a variable.

<RunnableExample
  code={`let fruits = ["apples", "oranges", "bananas"];
say(fruits);

// Change the value of the first element of the array.
fruits[0] = "pears";
say(fruits);
`}
/>

Finally, you can use the `push` function to add an element to the end
of an array. The push function expects two inputs: an array and the value
you want to add.

<RunnableExample
  code={`let words = ["fee", "fi"];
say(words);

// Add the elements "fo" and "fum" to the end of the array.
push(words, "fo");
push(words, "fum");
say(words);
`}
/>
