### Changing Arrays

You can add or replace elements in an existing array.

To replace a specific element in an array, use the assignment operator
(i.e. a single equals sign `=`). This is similar to changing the value
of a variable.

<RunnableExample
  code={`let fruits = ["apples", "oranges", "bananas"];
say(fruits);

// Change the value of the first element of the array.
fruits[0] = "pears";
say(fruits);
`}
/>

To add elements to the end of an array, use the `push` function. The push
function expects two inputs: an array and the value you want to add.

<RunnableExample
  code={`let words = ["fee", "fi"];
say(words);

// Add the elements "fo" and "fum" to the end of the array.
push(words, "fo");
say(words);
push(words, "fum");
say(words);
`}
/>
