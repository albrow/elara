### Function Outputs

Some functions may have an output, also called a "return value". If a
function has an output, it just means that it spits out a value whenever
it is called. The output of a function can be used the same way as
any other value.

For example, the `random` function outputs (or "returns") a random
number between 1 and 100. We can use the output of the `random` function
in the same way as any other number. E.g., we can use it as the _input_ to
the `say` function:

<RunnableExample
  code={`say(random());
`}
/>

Not all functions have an output. For example, the `move_right` function
does not output anything.
