### Function Outputs

<Video youTubeId="O1XoNe0MfVg" localVideoUrl={getLocalVideoUrl("function_outputs")}/>

Some functions may have an output, also called a "return value". If a
function has an output, it just means that it spits out a result whenever
it is called, and you can do things with the result.

<Card type="tip">Not all functions have an output. For example, the `move_forward` and `turn_left` functions do not output anything.</Card>

Let's take a look at a function called `get_orientation`. It outputs a string
based on which way the rover is facing. So for example, if the rover is facing to the
right, the `get_orientation` function will output `"right"`.

<Card type="try_it">Try adding more turns to the code below and see how the output of the `get_orientation` function changes.</Card>

<RunnableExample
  code={`// The get_orientation function outputs the direction the
// rover is facing.
say("I am facing " + get_orientation());

// If we turn to the right, the output of the function will
// change.
turn_right();
say("Now I am facing " + get_orientation());
`}
/>

The example below introduces a "data point". Data points are scattered throughout
Elara and can hold all kinds of information. The `read_data` function outputs whatever
data was stored in the data point.

<Card type="warning">The `read_data` function only works if the rover is next to a data point. Otherwise, it will cause an error.</Card>

<RunnableExample
  code={`// This code uses the *output* from the read_data function as
// the *input* to the say function. It will cause the rover
// to say whatever data is stored in the data point.
say(read_data());`}
