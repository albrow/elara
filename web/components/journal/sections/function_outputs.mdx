### Function Outputs

<YoutubeVideo embedId="9unIOhA-ALM" />

Some functions may have an output, also called a "return value". If a
function has an output, it just means that it spits out a result whenever
it is called, and you can do things with the result.

‚ÑπÔ∏è **Tip:** Not all functions have an output. For example, the `move_forward` and
`turn_left` functions do not output anything.

Let's take a look at a function called `get_orientation`. It outputs a string
based on which way the rover is facing. So for example, if the rover is facing to the
right, the `get_orientation` function will output `"right"`.

üí° **Try it:** Try adding more turns to the code below and see how the output
of `get_orientation` changes.

<RunnableExample
  code={`// The get_orientation function outputs the direction the rover
// is facing.
say("I am facing " + get_orientation());

// If we turn to the right, the output of the function will change.
turn_right();
say("Now I am facing " + get_orientation());
`}
/>

The example below introduces a "data terminal". Data terminals are scattered throughout
Elara and can hold all kinds of information. The `read_data` function outputs whatever
data was stored in the data terminal.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning** The `read_data` function only works if the rover is next to a data
terminal. Otherwise, the function will cause an error.

<RunnableExample
  code={`// This code uses the *output* from the read_data function as the
// *input* to the say function. It will cause the rover to say
// whatever data is stored in the data terminal.
say(read_data());`}
