### Function Outputs

<YoutubeVideo embedId="OfjwA6xDKsQ" />

Some functions may have an output, also called a "return value". If a
function has an output, it just means that it spits out a result whenever
it is called.

‚ÑπÔ∏è **Tip:** Not all functions have an output. For example, the `move_forward` and
`turn_left` functions do not output anything.

In the code below, we'll use the `add` function, which outputs the sum of two numbers.
We can use the output of the `add` function in the same way as any other number.

üí° **Try it:** Try changing the inputs to the `add` function and see how the output also
changes.

<RunnableExample
  code={`// The add function outputs the sum of two numbers, which we assign
// to a variable called result.
let result = add(2, 3);

// We can use the result variable in the same way as any other number.
say(result);
`}
