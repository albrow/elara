### Function Outputs

Some functions may have an output, also called a "return value". If a
function has an output, it just means that it spits out a result whenever
it is called.

‚ÑπÔ∏è **Tip:** Not all functions have an output. For example, the `move_forward` and
`turn_left` functions do not output anything.

In the code below, we'll use the `get_orientation` function, which outputs a string
based on which way the rover is facing. So for example, if the rover is facing to the
right, the `get_orientation` function will output `"right"`.

üí° **Try it:** Try adding more turns to the code below and see how the output
of `get_orientation` changes.

<RunnableExample
  code={`// The get_orientation function outputs the direction the rover
// is facing.
say("I am facing " + get_orientation());

// If we turn to the right, the output of the function will change.
turn_right();
say("Now I am facing " + get_orientation());
`}
/>
