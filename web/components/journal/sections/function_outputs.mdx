### Function Outputs

Some functions may have an output, also called a "return value". If a
function has an output, it just means that it spits out a value whenever
it is called. The output of a function can be used the same way as
any other value.

For example, the `add` function takes two numbers as inputs and outputs
the sum of those numbers. We can use the output of the `add` function in
the same way as any other number. Below, we use it as the _input_ to the
`say` function. This will cause the rover to say the result of 2 + 3.

<RunnableExample
  code={`say(add(2, 3));
`}
/>

ℹ️ **Tip:** Not all functions have an output. For example, the `move_right` function
does not output anything.
