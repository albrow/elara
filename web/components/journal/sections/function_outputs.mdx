### Function Outputs

Some functions may have an output, also called a "return value". If a
function has an output, it just means that it spits out a value whenever
it is called. The output of a function can be used the same way as
any other value.

For example, the `random` function outputs a random number between 1 and 100.
We can use the output of the `random` function in the same way as any
other number. Below, we use it as the _input_ to the `say` function. This
will cause the rover to say a random number.

<RunnableExample
  code={`say(random());
`}
/>

ℹ️ **Tip:** When a function does not have any inputs, you still need to include the
parentheses (just don't put anything inside them).

ℹ️ **Tip:** Not all functions have an output. For example, the `move_right` function
does not output anything.
