### If Statement

An if statement allows you to run a block of code if some condition is true.
You can use an if statement to perform different actions based on different
conditions.

You begin an if statement with the `if` keyword. Everything inside the curly
brackets `{` and `}` will be run if the condition is true. You can also optionally
extend an `if` statement by adding the `else` keyword. The code following the `else`
keyword will be run if the condition is _false_.

There is one more version of the `if` statement, which includes the `else if` keyword.
This allows you to check multiple different conditions in a single statement. When using
`else if`, the conditions are checked in order. If the first condition is false, then
the second condition is checked, and so on. An optional `else` statement at the end
will be run if none of the other conditions are true.

Just like a while loop, the conditions in an if statement are boolean
expressions.

#### Comparison Operators

The following comparison operators can be used in boolean expressions:

| Operator | Example  | Meaning                             |
| -------- | -------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `<`      | `x < 5`  | `x` is "less than" 5                |
| `>`      | `x > 5`  | `x` is "greater than" 5             |
| `==`     | `x == 5` | `x` is "equal to" 5                 |
| `!=`     | `x != 5` | `x` is "not equal to" 5             |
| `<=`     | `x <= 5` | `x` is "less than or equal to" 5    |
| `>=`     | `x >= 5` | `x` is "greater than or equal to" 5 |

#### Examples

If the variable `x` is less than 10, say "x is less than 10":

```rhai
let x = 5;
if x < 10 {
    say("x is less than 10");
}
```

If the variable `x` is less than 10, say "x is less than 10". Otherwise,
say "x is not less than 10".

```rhai
let x = 12;
if x < 10 {
    say("x is less than 10");
} else {
    say("x is not less than 10");
}
```

If the variable `x` is less than 5, move to the right. Otherwise, if `x` is less than
10, move to the left. Finally, if all other conditions are false, move down:

```rhai
let x = 7;
if x < 5 {
    move_right(1);
} else if x < 10 {
    move_left(1);
} else {
    move_down(1);
}
```
