### Comparisons

A "comparison expression" can be used to compare two different values.
For example, the comparison expression `1 < 2` results in `true`, because
1 is less than 2. The comparison expression `1 > 2` results in `false`.

<Card type="tip">In the examples below, it's a good idea to use the "Skip forward" and "Skip back" buttons so you can see each comparison one at a time!</Card>

<RunnableExample
  code={`// The rover will say "true" because 1 is less than 2.
say(1 < 2);

// The rover will say "false" because 1 is not greater than 2.
say(1 > 2);`}
/>

#### Comparison Operators

Here is the full list of comparison operators and what they mean:

| Operator | Description           | Example   |
| -------- | --------------------- | --------- |
| `<`      | Less than             | `1 < 2`   |
| `<=`     | Less than or equal    | `2 <= 3`  |
| `>`      | Greater than          | `3 > 4`   |
| `>=`     | Greater than or equal | `5 >= 6`  |
| `==`     | Equal                 | `7 == 8`  |
| `!=`     | Not equal             | `9 != 10` |

<Card type="tip">A single equals sign (`=`) is used to assign a value to a variable. If you want to check if two values are equal, remember to use two equals signs (`==`).</Card>

#### More Examples

Here are some more examples of comparison expressions.

<Card type="try_it">Check your understanding by changing the comparison expressions or adding your own.</Card>

<RunnableExample
  code={`say(2 <= 5);
say(3 >= 3);
say(4 != 4);

// Comparisons aren't just for numbers. You can compare
// strings too.
say("love" == "love");
say("apples" == "oranges");`}
/>

You can also use variables inside of comparison expressions.

<RunnableExample
  code={`let x = 2;
let y = 5;
say(x < y);`}
/>
