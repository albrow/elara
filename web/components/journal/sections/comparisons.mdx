### Comparisons

A "comparison expression" can be used to compare two different values.
For example, the comparison expression `1 < 2` results in `true`, because
1 is less than 2. The comparison expression `1 > 2` results in `false`.

Comparison expressions are similar to math expressions, but:

1. Instead of using a math operator like `+` or `-`, they use a comparison operator like `<` or `>`.
2. Instead of resulting in a number, they result in a boolean value (`true` or `false`).

#### Comparison Operators

Here is the full list of comparison operators and what they mean:

| Operator | Description           | Example   |
| -------- | --------------------- | --------- |
| `<`      | Less than             | `1 < 2`   |
| `<=`     | Less than or equal    | `2 <= 3`  |
| `>`      | Greater than          | `3 > 4`   |
| `>=`     | Greater than or equal | `5 >= 6`  |
| `==`     | Equal                 | `7 == 8`  |
| `!=`     | Not equal             | `9 != 10` |
