### Variables

You can think of variables as "containers" that you can put values into and then
reference later. Almost anything can be stored in a variable, and you can use
the variable in other places in your code.

To create a new variable, use the `let` keyword. In the example below, we
assign the value `"hello"` to a variable called `greeting`. Then we use
`greeting` as the input to the `say` function.

<RunnableExample
  code={`// Create a new variable named "greeting" with a value of "hello".
let greeting = "hello";

// Use the variable "greeting" as the input to the "say" function.
say(greeting);
`}
/>

After a variable is created, you can change the value it holds by using the
`=` operator again.

ℹ️ **Tip:** You don't need to use the `let` keyword when changing the
value of an existing variable.

<RunnableExample
  code={`// First create a new variable named "number" with a value of 5.
let number = 5;
say(number);

// Now change the value of "number" to 10.
number = 10;
say(number);
`}
/>

If a function has an output, you can assign the output to a variable. Here's
an example of assigning the output of the `random` function to a variable called
`random_number`.

<RunnableExample
  code={`let random_number = random();
say(random_number);
`}
/>

ℹ️ **Tip:** If you are ever unsure about the value a variable holds, you can use
the `say` function to have the rover say the value for you.
