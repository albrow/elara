### Variables

Any value can be assigned to a variable, which you can reference later on.
You can think of variables as "containers" that you can put values into.
You can declare a new variable with the `let` keyword.

**Tip:** If you are ever unsure about the value a variable holds, you can use
the `say` function to have the rover say the value for you.

#### Variable types

A variable has a "type" based on the value that was assigned to it. The
variable's type determines what you can do with it. For example, some
functions expect certain types as arguments. There are only a handful
of types you need to worry about for Elara:

| Type     | Example             | Description                                           |
| -------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `i64`    | `let x = 3`         | An integer, i.e. a whole number (including negatives) |
| `bool`   | `let x = true`      | A boolean, which can be either `true` or `false`      |
| `string` | `let x = "hello"`   | A string, i.e. a sequence of letters or symbols       |
| `array`  | `let x = [1, 2, 3]` | A list of values                                      |

#### Examples

Assigning the value `"hello"` to the variable named
`greeting`:

```rhai
let greeting = "hello";
say(greeting);
```

Assigning the return value the `get_pos` function
to the variable named `pos`:

```rhai
let pos = get_pos();
say(pos);
```
