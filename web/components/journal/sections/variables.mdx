### Variables

<Video youTubeId="BBerbG81LrI" localVideoUrl={getLocalVideoUrl("variables")}/>

You can think of variables as "containers" that you can put values into and then
use later. Almost anything can be stored in a variable: numbers, strings,
or even the output of a function.

To create a new variable, use the `let` keyword. In the example below, we
create a new variable called `x` and set it to `2`.

<Card type="try_it">Change `2` to a different number and see what happens.</Card>

<RunnableExample
  code={`// Create a new variable named x and set it to 2.
let x = 2;

// Now we can use x as the input to the say function.
say(x);

// We can treat x as a number and use it in math.
say(x + 1);
`}
/>

A variable can hold any type of value, including strings. In the example below,
we create a new variable called `greeting` and set it to `"Hello"`.

<Card type="tip">Don't use quotes around a variable name.</Card>

<Card type="try_it">Change `"Hello"` to a different string.</Card>

<RunnableExample
  code={`// Create a new variable named greeting and set it to "Hello".
let greeting = "Hello";
say(greeting);
`}
/>

If a function has an output, you can store it in a variable. This is super useful
when you want to save the output and use it later on.

<RunnableExample
  code={`// Store the output of the read_data function in a variable.
let data = read_data();

// Now we can use the variable later on in our code...
turn_right();
move_forward(1);
say(data);
`}
