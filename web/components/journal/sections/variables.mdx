### Variables

You can think of variables as "containers" that you can put values into and then
reference later. Almost anything can be stored in a variable, and you can use
the variable in other places in your code.

To create a new variable, use the `let` keyword. In the example below, we
assign the value `"hello"` to a variable called `greeting`. Then we use
`greeting` as the input to the `say` function. Try changing `"hello"` to
something else and see what happens.

ℹ️ **Tip:** Don't use quotes around the variable name.

<RunnableExample
  code={`// Create a new variable named greeting with a value of "hello".
let greeting = "hello";

// Use the variable greeting as the input to the say function.
say(greeting);
`}
/>

After a variable is created, you can change the value it holds by using the
`=` operator again.

ℹ️ **Tip:** You don't need to use the `let` keyword when changing the
value of an existing variable.

<RunnableExample
  code={`// First create a new variable named my_number with a value of 5.
let my_number = 5;
say(my_number);

// Now change the value of my_number to 10.
my_number = 10;
say(my_number);
`}
/>

If a function has an output, you can assign the output to a variable. The
example below assigns the output of the `add` function to a variable called
`result`.

<RunnableExample
  code={`// The add function outputs the sum of two numbers, which we assign
// to a variable called result.
let result = add(4, 2);

// Now we can use the variable as the input to the say function.
say(result);
`}
/>

ℹ️ **Tip:** Going forward, if you are ever unsure about the value a variable
holds, you can use the `say` function to have G.R.O.V.E.R. say the value for you.
