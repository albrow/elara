### Variables

Any value can be assigned to a variable, which you can reference later on.
You can think of variables as "containers" that you can put values into.
You can declare a new variable with the `let` keyword.

Here's an example of creating a new variable named `x` and assigning the value
`42` to it:

```rhai
let x = 42;
```

You can use a variable the same way that you would use the underlying value.
For example, you can pass a variable to the `say` function:

```rhai
let greeting = "hello";
say(greeting);
```

After a variable is created, you can change the value it holds by using the
`=` operator again. You don't need to use the `let` keyword when changing the
value of an existing variable.

```rhai
let number = 5;
say(number);
number = 10;
say(number);
```

If a function has an output, you can assign the output to a variable. Here's
an example of assigning the output of the `random` function to a variable called
`random_number`.

```rhai
let random_number = random();
say(random_number);
```

ℹ️ **Tip:** If you are ever unsure about the value a variable holds, you can use
the `say` function to have the rover say the value for you.
