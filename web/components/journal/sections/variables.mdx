### Variables

You can think of variables as "containers" that you can put values into and then
reference later. Almost anything can be stored in a variable, and you can use
the variable in other places in your code.

To create a new variable, use the `let` keyword. In the example below, we
create a new variable called `x` and set it to `2`.

💡 **Try it:** Change `2` to a different number and see what
happens.

<RunnableExample
  code={`// Create a new variable named x and set it to 2.
let x = 2;

// Now we can use x as the input to the say function.
say(x);

// We can treat x as a number and use it in math.
say(x + 1);
`}
/>

A variable can hold any type of value, including strings. In the example below,
we create a new variable called `greeting` and set it to `"Hello"`.

ℹ️ **Tip:** Don't use quotes around a variable name.

💡 **Try it:** Change `"Hello"` to a different string.

<RunnableExample
  code={`// Create a new variable named greeting and set it to "Hello".
let greeting = "Hello";
say(greeting);
`}
/>
