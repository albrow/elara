### Strings

Strings are pieces of text surrounded by quotes (`"` and `"`). You've already
seen some strings in previous examples, but here are some more examples:

<Card type="try_it">Try changing some of the strings below.</Card>

<RunnableExample
  code={`say("Hello, world!");
say("I'm a string!");
say("I'm a string too!");`}
/>
