### Strings

Strings are pieces of text surrounded by quotes (`"` and `"`). You've already
seen some strings in previous examples, but here are some more:

<RunnableExample
  code={`say("Hello, world!");
say("I'm a string!");
say("I'm a string too!");`}
/>

ℹ️ **Tip:** Try removing the quotes from the strings above and see what happens. It's an error!
That's because the quotes tell the computer that the text is a string, and without them
the computer doesn't know what to do with the text.
