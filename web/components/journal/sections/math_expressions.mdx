### Math Expressions

A math expression uses numbers and a mathematical operator
(e.g. `+` or `-`) to produce a new number. You may already be
familiar with math expressions from your math class.

Since math expressions result in a number, they can be used
in your code anywhere a number can be used. For example, you
can use a math expression in the `move_right` function:

```rhai
move_right(1 + 2);
```

Since `1 + 2` results in `3`, the above code will cause the
rover to move right 3 spaces.

#### Math Operators

There are a few different kinds of operators that can be used in
math expressions.

| Operator | Description    | Example |
| -------- | -------------- | ------- |
| `+`      | Addition       | `1 + 2` |
| `-`      | Subtraction    | `3 - 4` |
| `*`      | Multiplication | `5 * 6` |
| `/`      | Division       | `7 / 8` |

#### Order of Operations

Math expressions follow the same order of operations you're
probably used to. For example, multiplication and division
are done before addition or subtraction. For example, `2 + 3 * 4`
results in `14` because `3 * 4` is done first, then `2 + 14`.

As you might expect, you can use parentheses to change the order
of operations. For example, `(2 + 3) * 4` results in `20` because
`2 + 3` is done first, then `20 * 4`.
